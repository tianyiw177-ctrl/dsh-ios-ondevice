# profile has no pnpm install behind it, so the bundle is plumbed by hand here.
#
# The shape matters, and the first attempt got it wrong in a way that aborted the
# whole plugin tree. dsh manages <profile>/.dsh-module-fallback/node_modules/<pkg>
# itself and treats anything there that is neither a symlink nor a dsh-managed ESM
# proxy directory as hostile -- ensureSymlink() throws "exists and is not a
# symlink or dsh-managed module proxy" and profile init dies. This build used to
# write two plain text files holding a path (one at each level of the chain); dsh
# choked on the first one, and the only thing visible on device was
#   Cannot find package '@brianynwu/dsh-tui' imported from /root/.dsh/profiles/tui/
# The fallback directory is also swept by dsh's own cleanup: a name that is not in
# the bundle closure gets removeProfileSymlink()ed, so anything parked there has
# to expect deletion.
#
# So: one symlink, in the profile's own node_modules, pointing straight at the
# installation copy, and nothing at all in .dsh-module-fallback (dsh heals that
